# About me :woman_technologist:	
I am a biomedical engineer working in the field of AI applied to medical image analysis. The focus of my research activity, both as a research fellow and as a PhD student, is the building of Deep Learning models using the Few-Shot Learning approach through the Meta-Learning paradigm. The clinical question addressed concerns the automated assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness using MRI acquisitions.
